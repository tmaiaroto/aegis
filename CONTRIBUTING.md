# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

If you are working on an open issue, please be sure to test the code to the best of your ability.
While test cases are not required as part of contributing, they are always helpful.

Please note this project's simple code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions.

Also note that not every pull request or issue can always be addressed. The project maintainers
reserve the right to ignore, close, or move any issue or pull request. Especially if requests 
are not in line with the goals of the tool and its authors. That said, feedback and suggestions 
are vital to any open-source project and are _always appreciated_.

The simple reality of it is that we all have jobs and can't always be super responsive.
Please do not take anything personally.

## Pull Request Process

1. Be sure to sign the [CLA](https://cla-assistant.io/tmaiaroto/aegis)
2. Ensure any code is accompanied by a test case should it make sense.
3. Ensure your contribution does not break any existing test cases.
4. If it makes sense, update the README.md with details of changes should there be a breaking 
   change to the brief documentation within it or if new information makes sense.
5. Increase the version number in `version/version.go`. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
6. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of another developer, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request someone to merge it for you.
